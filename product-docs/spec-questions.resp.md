Okay, let's break down the requirements for your spending tracker web application. Answering these questions will help you build a comprehensive specification.

**I. Core Purpose & Scope**

1.  **Primary Goal:** What is the absolute core problem this application solves? (e.g., Simple expense logging? Detailed budget management? Financial analysis?)
2.  **Target User:** Who are you building this for primarily? (Yourself? Friends? A wider audience?) This impacts complexity and feature set.
3.  **Minimum Viable Product (MVP):** What are the *must-have* features for the very first version? What can wait for later releases?
4.  **Beyond MVP:** What are the "nice-to-have" features or future potential additions?

**II. Core Functionality: Tracking Transactions**

5.  **Transaction Types:** Will it only track expenses, or also income? What about transfers between accounts?
6.  **Required Data Fields per Transaction:** What information *must* be captured for each expense/income item? (e.g., Amount, Date, Category, Description/Notes, Account used?)
7.  **Optional Data Fields:** What additional information *could* be useful? (e.g., Tags, Location, Receipt attachment, Payment method?)
8.  **Input Method:** How will users add transactions? (A detailed form? A quick-add bar? Import from CSV/bank files?)
9.  **Editing/Deleting:** How will users modify or remove existing transactions? What are the constraints?
10. **Recurring Transactions:** Does the system need to handle recurring expenses/income automatically (e.g., rent, salary, subscriptions)? How will these be set up and managed?

**III. Data Organization & Management**

11. **Categories:**
    * Will categories be predefined, user-defined, or a mix?
    * Should categories support hierarchy (e.g., Food -> Groceries, Food -> Restaurants)?
    * Can categories have associated icons or colors?
12. **Accounts:**
    * Will the app track spending across multiple accounts (e.g., Checking, Savings, Credit Card, Cash)?
    * What information is needed for an account (Name, Type, Starting Balance, Currency)?
    * How are transfers between accounts handled to avoid double-counting expenses/income?
13. **Tags/Labels:** Besides categories, is there a need for a more flexible tagging system?
14. **Currencies:** Will the application need to support multiple currencies? How will exchange rates be handled (if at all)?

**IV. Budgeting & Goals**

15. **Budgeting Feature:** Is budgeting a core requirement?
    * How are budgets set? (Per category, overall, per time period - weekly, monthly, yearly?)
    * How is budget progress tracked and visualized?
    * Should there be warnings or notifications when approaching/exceeding a budget?
16. **Financial Goals:** Should users be able to set savings goals (e.g., "Save $500 for vacation")? How would progress towards these be tracked?

**V. Reporting & Visualization**

17. **Data Display:** How should transactions be displayed? (List view, calendar view?)
18. **Summaries:** What kind of summary information is needed on the main dashboard? (e.g., Total spending this month, Spending by category, Recent transactions, Account balances?)
19. **Reports:** What specific reports are essential? (e.g., Spending over time, Income vs. Expense, Spending by category/tag?)
20. **Visualization:** What types of charts or graphs would be useful? (e.g., Pie charts for category breakdown, line charts for spending trends?)
21. **Filtering & Searching:** How will users find specific transactions or filter data? (By date range, category, amount, description keyword?)
22. **Data Export:** Should users be able to export their data? In what format (CSV, JSON, PDF)?

**VI. User Accounts & Authentication**

23. **User System:** Will it be a single-user application, or support multiple users with separate accounts?
24. **Authentication:** How will users log in? (Email/Password? Social logins like Google/GitHub?)
25. **Security:** What measures are needed for password storage (hashing), session management, and protecting user data?
26. **User Profile:** What user-specific settings are needed (e.g., Default currency, date format, profile information)?

**VII. Technical Architecture & Stack (Considering your familiarity)**

27. **Frontend Framework (Vite/JS/TS):** Are you leaning towards a specific framework (React, Vue, Svelte) or vanilla JS/TS?
28. **UI/UX:** Will you use a component library (like Material UI, Chakra UI, Tailwind CSS) or build custom styles? How important is responsiveness (desktop, tablet, mobile)?
29. **State Management (Frontend):** How will application state be managed on the client-side? (Context API, Redux, Zustand, Pinia, etc.)
30. **Backend Framework (Node.js):** Will you use a framework like Express, Fastify, Koa, or NestJS?
31. **API Design:** How will the frontend and backend communicate? (RESTful API, GraphQL?) Define the key API endpoints.
32. **Database (SQL):**
    * Which SQL database are you most comfortable with or prefer (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite)?
    * How will you interact with the database from Node.js? (An ORM like Prisma, Sequelize, TypeORM, or raw SQL queries?)
    * What is the initial database schema design (tables, columns, relationships, indexes)?
33. **Real-time Features:** Are any real-time updates needed (e.g., budget progress updating instantly)? If so, consider WebSockets.
34. **Offline Support/PWA:** Is it desirable for the app to work offline or be installable as a Progressive Web App (PWA)?

**VIII. Non-Functional Requirements**

35. **Performance:** What are the acceptable loading times and response times for key actions?
36. **Scalability:** How many users/transactions should the system be able to handle initially and potentially in the future?
37. **Security:** Beyond authentication, what other security considerations are there? (Input validation, preventing XSS/CSRF/SQL Injection, HTTPS enforcement).
38. **Maintainability:** How will the code be structured for ease of understanding and future changes? (Linting, formatting, code comments, documentation).
39. **Testing:** What is the testing strategy? (Unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests? Which testing frameworks/libraries?)
40. **Accessibility (a11y):** What level of web accessibility compliance is required (WCAG standards)?

**IX. Deployment & Operations**

41. **Hosting:** Where will the application be deployed? (Cloud platforms like Vercel, Netlify, AWS, GCP, Azure, or self-hosted?)
42. **CI/CD:** Will you set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline?
43. **Monitoring & Logging:** How will application errors and performance be monitored?
44. **Backups:** What is the database backup strategy?

Answering these questions thoroughly will give you a solid foundation for your `SPECIFICATION.md` or similar document, making the development process much smoother. Good luck with your project!
